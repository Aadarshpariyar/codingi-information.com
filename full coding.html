	<h2 style="color: #24b1a4; font-family: sans-serif;">What is coding? </h2>
	<p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;">Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers.<br>Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions.<br>By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way.<br> You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.</p>

	<h2 style="color:#24b1a4; font-family: sans-serif;">Why learn how to code?</h2>
	<p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;">We all have hopes, dreams, and plans for the future. Whether you’re looking for a new opportunity,<br> want to optimize your current job, or are simply searching for a new hobby, coding can help you<br> get closer to your goals. And remember, anyone can learn how to code!</p>

	<h2 style="color:#24b1a4; font-family: sans-serif;">Careers Where Learning Code Is Helpful</h2>
	<p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;">Readers can find many different kinds of <b>coding careers</b>, including <b>computer programmer</b>, <b>web developer</b>,<br> and <b>database administrator roles</b>. Learn more about potential software developer careers below:</p>

	<h3 style="color:#24b1a4; font-family: sans-serif;">-<mark>Computer Programmer</mark></h3>
	<p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;">Computer programmers write and test code for applications, software, and websites. These professionals<br> typically know multiple coding languages. They may work individually or as part of a team. Computer programmers<br> earned a median annual salary of $89,190 in May 2020. The BLS projects a 10% job decline between 2020 and 2030.</p>

	<h3 style="color:#24b1a4; font-family: sans-serif;">-<mark>Computer Network Architect</mark></h3>
	<p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;">These professionals build data communication networks, including wide area networks and intranets.<br> These networks may be small-scale — such as a connection within an office — or as large scale as<br> cloud computing. The BLS found that computer network architects earned a median annual salary<br> of $116,780 in May 2020. This career is projected to grow 5% between 2020 and 2030.</p>

	<h3 style="color:#24b1a4; font-family: sans-serif;">What are the 4 types of coding?</h3>
	<p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;">There are four types of coding:</p>
	<pre style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;">-Data compression (or source coding)
    -Error control (or channel coding)
    -Cryptographic coding.
    -Line coding.</pre>s

    <h3 style="color:#24b1a4; font-family: sans-serif;">Is Learning to Code Difficult?</h3>
    <p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;">Coding isn’t that hard for tech-savvy people who patiently put in the time and effort to learn.<br> Coding gets an unnecessarily bad reputation from people who weren’t persistent enough to practice.<br> The easiest coding languages only involve a few hundred terms and rules to remember. That’s<br> a tiny sliver in comparison to learning a spoken foreign language. Once the easier languages are<br> mastered, it’s relatively simple to learn other ways to code. Many programming languages use similar<br> methods to code and debug computer applications.</p>
    <p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;">Beginners starting to code must possess certain skills to be successful. Having strong attention<br> to detail to pour over long lines of coded text is imperative. New coders need abstract thinking<br> skills to visualize what written code will become. Novices must have problem-solving skills to persist<br> against challenges without letting frustration win. Intuitive logical reasoning skills help coders<br> correctly conclude why a code isn’t working right. Good writing skills are critical to creating code<br> that appropriately conveys the intended message. Technology skills are also an obvious requirement<br> for coders to fearlessly work with computer programs.</p>

    <h4 style="color:#24b1a4; font-family: sans-serif;">Popular Coding Languages to Learn</h4>
    <p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;">Since the 1970s, computer experts have created more than 700 different programming languages.<br> Each language has a unique way of helping computers process huge amounts of information. Every<br> coding language has different features and terms with some overlap. New coders shouldn’t be<br> overwhelmed by the plethora of programming types though. There are only about a dozen programming<br> languages that are commonly used. These include Ruby, Swift, JavaScript, Cobol, Objective-C,<br> Visual Basic, and Perl. Let’s look at some of the major coding languages about which beginners should know.</p>
    <p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;"><mark>HTML</mark> –HTML, or hypertext markup language, is the standard way of coding web pages to showcase electronic<br> information. Founded by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is used to format the content, pictures, and videos<br> featured online. HTML tells the internet browser how to display websites for an optimal user experience.</p>
    <p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;"><mark>Java</mark> – Java is an object-oriented coding language created by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java has English-based<br> commands used to create applications for a single computer or whole server and tiny applets for websites. Java is<br> a popular favorite for programming mobile apps and video games, especially on Android operating systems.</p>
    <p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;"><mark>Python</mark> – Python is a server-side web and software development language started by Guido van Rossum in 1991.<br> Python has a simple, English-like syntax to script back-end actions for applications, user interfaces, and operating<br> systems that work well. Many platforms, including Google and NASA’s Integrated Planning System, use Python.</p>
    <p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;"><mark>CSS</mark> – CSS, or cascading style sheets, is a coding language used to specify a website’s style. Developed by<br> Håkon Wium Lie in 1994, CSS tells internet browsers each page’s layout, background color, font size, cursor shape,<br> and more. Crafting and maintaining solid CSS code is crucial for websites to have aesthetic appeal.</p>
    <p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;"><mark>C Language</mark> – C Language is a simple, low-level coding type initiated in 1972 by Bell Labs to build the UNIX system.<br> Perhaps the easiest language, C has just 32 basic keywords used for scripting embedded systems, network drivers,<br> and artificial intelligence. C language is versatile to get computer hardware communicating.</p>
    <p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;"><mark>C++</mark> – C++ is another object-oriented programming language that expands on C to execute higher-level computer tasks.<br> Released in 1983 by Bjarne Stroustrup, C++ organizes and stores info in bundles for more complex programs. Adobe,<br> Microsoft Office, Amazon, and Mozilla software utilizes C++ for fast processing.</p>
    <p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;"><mark>PHP</mark> – PHP, or hypertext processor, is a coding language for web development founded in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf.<br> PHP is widely used for server scripting with HTML to piece together dynamic website content. WordPress, an<br> open-source online platform that accounts for 20 percent of websites and blogs, is notably written with PHP.</p>
    <p style="color:#ededed; font-family: cursive;"><mark>SQL</mark> – SQL, or structured query language, is a domain-specific coding type that streams information into a database.<br> First introduced by IBM researchers in 1974, SQL has simple syntax to run back-end web databases. SQL is used by<br> most businesses to load, retrieve, and analyze text or numbers in their servers.</p>
